Executive Summary

Problem Two:
To normalize this table in 1ST NF, each cell must contain a single value.  The studentâ€™s name will need to divided into the firstname, and last name categories. The classes column can only contain one value per cell. Two additional collumns will need to be added for Joe Smith. The values of ENG1010 and IT1090 will need to be moved to these columns. Sue Brown will also require two additional columns. The values of IT1150 and ITNT2300 will need to be seperated into individual columns. Kate Jones will require oe addtional column. The value of IT1050 will need to be seperated into an individual column. The rows must

To be in second normal form, all attributes must be dependent on the key. Once the student's identification number is added, the remaining attributes are dependent on the student's indentity and the identification numner. This table is is 2nd NF. 

To normalize this table in 3rd NF,
